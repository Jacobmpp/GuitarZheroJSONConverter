# GuitarZheroJSONConverter
Conversion tool to convert Clone Hero files into Guitar Zhero files.
After compiled, the converter is looking for a Clone Hero formatted file in the same directory as the code.
It will then convert to GuitarZhero format and create a new file, with the name being the same name as the Clone Hero file,
But the extension will be .json since we are creating a JSON file.
